// launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). New Note Fixer's feature surface is a WorkspaceLeaf.openLinkText
// patch with no public API interface, so only the PluginSettings config class is
// reflected; the plugin's runtime behavior is covered by the other unit tests.
